# Contribution Guidelines for Awesome AI Agents

Welcome to the forefront of autonomous software! The AI Agent ecosystem moves incredibly fast, which means we must aggressively filter out noise and unmaintained projects.

## Strict Quality Filters
To be merged into this repository, a project MUST:
* **Be Active:** Have commits within the last 30 days. We do not accept dead projects.
* **Be More Than a Wrapper:** We reject simple API wrappers. The project must demonstrate genuine autonomous reasoning, multi-agent orchestration, or complex tool use.
* **Have Documentation:** Must include clear installation instructions and usage examples in its own README.

## Pull Request Workflow
1. Ensure the project is not already listed.
2. Fork the repo and create a branch (e.g., `feat/add-new-agent-framework`).
3. Add the entry using the exact format: `* [Tool](link) - Short description.`
4. Open a PR and provide a brief summary of the agent's core capabilities.

The maintainers reserve the right to decline any PR that dilutes the high-signal nature of this list.
