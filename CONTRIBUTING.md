# Contribution Guidelines for Awesome Industrial Tech

Thank you for helping us build the ultimate resource for intelligent manufacturing! This repository is proudly curated by the Atomu Lab community. 

Our goal is to bridge the gap between IT and OT (Operational Technology). Therefore, we prioritize stability, standard protocols, and real-world applicability.

## Submission Requirements
* **Industrial Standards:** We highly favor projects that support recognized industrial protocols (e.g., MQTT, OPC UA, Modbus) or standard PLC architectures.
* **Open Architecture:** Hardware projects must include CAD files or PCB schematics.
* **Real-World Proven:** Experimental projects are welcome, but please indicate if the software/hardware is currently deployed in a real manufacturing environment.

## The PR Process
1. Search the existing list to prevent duplicates.
2. Fork the repository and make your additions in a new branch.
3. Keep descriptions objective and concise (no marketing jargon).
4. Submit your Pull Request. In the PR comments, briefly explain how this project contributes to open architecture manufacturing.

Welcome to the Atomu Lab ecosystem! We look forward to reviewing your contributions.
